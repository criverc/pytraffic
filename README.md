# pytraffic
A Python3 Library for building traffic simulations using pygame

###By Carlos Rivera

###USAGE:
1. Create trajectories by combining arcs and lines.
2. Add balls, and set their speeds (which can of
   course be changed during the simulation).
3. Let the simulation begin!

See examples under examples subdirectory

###TODO:
1. There are still no collisions!!
2. We should add a pretty background with streets.
3. We should display more data on the screen.
4. There is only one example.

To install use:

python3 setup.py install
